This is the Todo list precising the required things before a clean release.

It is important to know what parameters of generalData_ can be changed from the outside and when
I think two categories can be noticed:
1\ Those mutable "at will" by the user, ie during run time, and smartly (ie like the reference in velocity)
2\ Those not mutable OR only at the cost of the recomputation of the precomputed matrices.
-- Whereas in a first time they can be fixed, it leaves room for reflexion concerning the initialization of
-- those matrices (typically, they should be initialiazed after the construction).

/////
// The following are important remarks (maybe not all are necessary for a(n) (urgent) release)

MPCData and especially RobotData, shouldn't they rather point to parameters instead of containing them? - Data has often a better place (robot_ for RobotData)

Reintroduce 3d convex hulls and correspondent constraints on the com and feet - had been implemented before

Public api not well defined (Access to robot and solver important)
