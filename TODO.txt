This is the Todo list precising the required things before a clean release. 

Complete the documentation

Make a real unittest out of test-walkgen
(Use Romeo data rather than hrp2 data)

Add a switch for the displays (amelif and debug)

Clean the public interface: some attributes appear twice, and the method
CallMethod does nothing at all sometimes !

It is important to know what parameters of generalData_ can be changed from the outside and when
I think two categories can be noticed:
1\ Those mutable "at will" by the user, ie during run time, and smartly (ie like the reference in velocity)
2\ Those not mutable OR only at the cost of the recomputation of the precomputed matrices.
-- Whereas in a first time they can be fixed, it leaves room for reflexion concerning the initialization of
-- those matrices (typically, they should be initialiazed after the construction).

Remove the remaining TODO in the code.

Fix QPMatrix - NbVarMin should be removed
	(is QPMatrix necessary?)

/////
// The following are important remarks (maybe not all are necessary for a(n) (urgent) release)

Reintroduce class RigidBody - absolutely necessary for multiBody

Move ::display(�) out of QPGenerator - generator is generating not displaying

Distinguish enums from variables by changing enum naming convention - confusing

MPCData and especially RobotData, shouldn't they rather point to parameters instead of containing them? - Data has often a better place (robot_ for RobotData)

(Re)Introduce dump() functions in structures and classes - convenient debugging, had been (partly) implemented before

Reintroduce 3d convex hulls and correspondent constraints on the com and feet - had been implemented before

Initialization still hard coded

Can interpolation be relative to a RigidBody? - CoM.interpolate()
